# Benny's Notes
* Todo: branch in typescript
* Used Sinatra for a simple server.
* The back end (although it is so simple it could be in the controller) is a separate js class
* I used onclick events in the html, which I know is not ideal as you want to add these events
in the controller, but jquery wasn't doing this for me for some reason.
* I did not used angular (I tried!) as I could not set up the testing environment; running into
error after error with very little supporting documentation or stackoverflow material. I also
tried to use jasmine via npm and bower, which also gave me errors that I could not find the solution
to.


# Todo Challenge

* You may use whatever level of JavaScript you feel comfortable with - pure JS, jQuery, Angular, or whatever weird and wonderful framework you want to try. Extra points for DogeScript

Steps

1. Fill out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan
2. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine
3. Complete the following challenge:

## Challenge

![Todo mockup](https://makersacademy.mybalsamiq.com/mockups/2914603.png?key=afabb09aef2901a2732515ae4349c1ec0458294b)

Build a Todo list as a mini front-end application. You don't have to use a database, the front-end is more important - you can use an appropriate data structure stored somewhere in your JavaScript (this time only!)

Here are the core user stories:

```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice
```

Here are some other user stories you may choose to implement:

```
As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
```

As you may imagine, implementing a To-do list is very much a solved problem. However, we are mainly interested in seeing how you approach testing and design. We are looking for:

* well written, well structured acceptance and unit tests
* clear and expressive JavaScript
* good HTML5 markup

Don't worry about deployment, and make sure you read the CONTRIBUTING.md when submitting a pull request.

## Extensions

* Deploy the app
* Create a persistance layer (e.g. MongoDB), or use LocalStorage or the filesystem through Node
* Make it look purdy (CSS) - try a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation

Good luck!
